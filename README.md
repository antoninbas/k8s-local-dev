# kind-sandbox

A sandbox with configurations **ready to go** for kind + **CNI**. 

[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using containers as “nodes”. 

kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

Keep in mind, [flannel](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel) doesn't support Network Policy**
